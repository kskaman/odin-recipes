    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3.5 pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2.5 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare all ingredients and preheat
            your oven to 350°F (175°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Generously season the beef roast on all sides with
            3 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt, 2 teaspoons of
            black pepper, and garlic powder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.
            Add the seasoned beef and sear without moving until
            a golden-brown crust forms, approximately 4 minutes.
            Turn the meat to brown all sides, then remove from
            the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lower the heat to medium-high and add butter to the
            skillet. Once melted, incorporate the chopped onion,
            halved mushrooms, and carrot pieces. Sauté for about
            5 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping up any
            browned bits from the bottom. Add the halved garlic
            head and cook for an additional minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the red wine, stirring to deglaze the pan and
            lift any remaining flavors. Return the seared beef to
            the skillet along with any juices that have collected.
            Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and Worcestershire sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the beef broth just enough to cover two-thirds
            of the beef. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the skillet and transfer it to the preheated oven.
            Allow the beef to braise for 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
            or until the meat is fork-tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once done, remove the skillet from the oven. Discard the
            bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Let the beef rest for a few
            minutes before slicing. Serve the sliced beef with the
            vegetables and sauce, garnished with freshly chopped parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chef's Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cutting the beef into smaller chunks ensures
            even browning and tenderness.
        </li>
        <li>
            A chuck roast is perfect for braising as it stays
            juicy and tender during the long cooking process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure the beef isn't fully submerged in the
            liquid to achieve the best braised flavor.
