    <ul>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>            
        <li>1 tablespoon minced parsley</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups arrabbiata pasta sauce</li>
        <li>0.25 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Fill a large pot with water, add a pinch of salt,
            and bring to a boil. Cook the egg noodles until
            they are tender yet firm, about 7 to 9 minutes.
            Drain the noodles and mix them with butter, parsley,
            0.5 teaspoon salt, and 0.5 teaspoon pepper. Keep the
            noodles warm while you prepare the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set your Instant Pot to the Saute function. Add
            olive oil, sliced shallots, and chopped garlic to
            the pot. Cook until aromatic, approximately 2 to 3
            minutes. Stir in the arrabbiata pasta sauce,
            chicken broth, and red wine vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the chicken thighs with the remaining teaspoon
            of salt and half teaspoon of pepper. Place the seasoned
            chicken into the Instant Pot. Secure and lock the lid,
            then select the high-pressure setting. Cook for 12 minutes,
            allowing 10 to 15 minutes for the pressure to build.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the cooking time is complete, use the natural release
            method for about 10 minutes, then carefully perform a
            quick release to let out any remaining pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, combine 0.5 cup of yogurt with 0.5 cup
            of the sauce from the pot, adding it gradually to temper
            the yogurt. Mix in the paprika thoroughly. Pour this yogurt
            mixture back into the Instant Pot. Shred the cooked chicken
            thighs and serve them over the prepared noodles.
            Add a dollop of yogurt to each serving for garnish.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook's Tips</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>For a creamy texture, you can substitute
            sour cream in place of yogurt if preferred.</li> 
        <li><strong>Stovetop Preparation:</strong> Season the
            chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper.
            Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat for 2
            to 3 minutes, then add olive oil and the chicken.
            Brown the chicken on both sides for 3 to 4 minutes each.
            Incorporate shallots, garlic, and paprika, cooking until
            fragrant for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the pasta sauce and
            vinegar, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer
            until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of
            185°F (85°C), about 15 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile,
            prepare the egg noodles as described above. Once the
            chicken is done, drain the noodles and return them to
            the pot. Add butter, parsley, and the remaining 0.5 teaspoon
            each of salt and pepper, stirring until the butter melts.
            Remove the pan from heat, shred the chicken lightly, 
            and stir in 0.5 cup yogurt. Serve the chicken mixture
            over the noodles, adding the remaining yogurt on top.
            Enjoy immediately.</li>
        <li>
            If you opt for the stovetop method, you can skip
            adding chicken broth.
