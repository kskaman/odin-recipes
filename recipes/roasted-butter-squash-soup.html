    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This roasted butternut squash soup is my top pick for autumn.
        It's budget-friendly, simple to make, nourishing, and utterly
        tasty! For a heartier option, consider adding crispy bacon bits
        or diced ham on top.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Soup:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, whole and peeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3 1/2 pound) butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise and seeded</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth, with extra if necessary</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>0.5 cup crème fraîche</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh chives, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Sage Brown Butter:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 fresh sage leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all necessary ingredients and preheat your
            oven to 400°F (200°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> Drizzle
            olive oil into a large roasting pan. Add the chopped onion,
            sliced carrots, whole garlic cloves, and a generous pinch
            of salt. Toss to ensure the vegetables are well-coated with
            oil. Place the butternut squash halves on top of the vegetables,
            cut side facing upwards. Sprinkle additional salt over the squash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the oven until the squash is soft and easily pierced
            with a knife, approximately 1 hour. Once done, remove from
            the oven and let the vegetables cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the Sage Brown Butter : </strong> In a saucepan,
            melt the butter over medium heat. Allow it to foam and begin
            to turn golden. Lower the heat to prevent burning. When the butter
            reaches a light brown, nutty aroma, remove from heat and quickly
            stir in the sage leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine and Simmer:</strong> Scoop the flesh from the
            roasted squash and add it to a large stockpot along with the
            roasted vegetables. Po
            ur in the chicken broth, the sage-infused
            brown butter, and maple syrup. Place the pot over high heat and
            bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let
            it simmer gently for 45 to 60 minutes to allow the flavors to
            meld. Remove from heat afterward.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth,
            about 3 to 4 minutes. For an extra smooth texture, strain the mixture
            through a fine sieve to eliminate any remaining fibrous pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the soup is too thick for your liking, gradually add a few
            tablespoons of water or additional chicken broth until desired
            consistency is reached. Stir in the cider vinegar, adjust salt
            if necessary, and add a pinch of cayenne pepper for a subtle heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <!-- alt + 0232 for è ; Alt + 0238 for î -->
            Serve the soup warm, garnished with a spoonful of crème fraîche
            and a sprinkle of chopped chives.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chef's Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Enhance the soup's richness by topping it with crispy
            bacon bits or diced ham.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper based on your
            preferred spice level.
        </li>
        <li>
            For a vegan alternative, replace chicken broth with vegetable
            broth and use a plant-based crème fraîche substitute.
        </li>
    </ul>
